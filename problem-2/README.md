# Task 2: Conditionally show HTML based on boolean (lv1)

## Description

Modify the 'TodoViewComponent' HTML template to conditionally render sections of HTML based on the value of the todo 'complete' variable. 
If 'complete' is true, display the div with the 'complete' text and hide the div with the 'notComplete' text. 
If 'complete' is false, display the div with the 'notComplete' text and hide the div with the 'Complete' text.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Use the correct Angular directive to conditionally render HTML and place it on a `div` with the 'Complete' text and place it on a `div` with the 'notComplete' text.
- Change the number within the "getTodo" method in ngOnInit hook to test. "1" will return an incomplete todo while "4" will return a complete todo.
