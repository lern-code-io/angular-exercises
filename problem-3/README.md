# Task: Add route to allow for navigation to user profile in app.routes.ts (lv1)

## Description
Navigation is fundamental to all web applications. User should be able to click navigational links and be 
redirected to the expected page. In Angular we add navigational routs in the app.routs.ts folder. In this task
we have two pages - teh 'allUsersPage' and the 'userOnePage'. The 'allUsersPge' has a navigational link that 
will lead the user to the 'userOnePage' and the 'userOnePage' has a return link. The HTML is set up and does not
need to be edited. The app.routes.ts is missing a navigational route object that will lead the user from the 
'allUsersPage' to 'userOnePage'. The task is to add the missing route object.
Good luck!

## Acceptance Criteria
- Add one path object to the 'app.routes.ts' file. The path will be '/userone' and the component to route to is 'UserOnePageComponent' .
- Load up the application and route it to user one from the all users page.
