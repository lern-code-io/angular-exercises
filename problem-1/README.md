# Task: Creating a For Loop in Angular (lv1)

## Description
Loops are a foundational topic in Angular - it allows us to loop through an array and display some HTML for each element.
We can fill the HTML with dynamic content that is specific to the element we are currently considering in an array. 
In the `ViewbookComponent`, there is an array of Stephen King novels. The task is to loop through this array and display each title and book image. 
The HTML/CSS is provided - all that is needed is to add the Angular directive used for looping through an array.
The next step is to grab the current element from the Angular directive defined and use it to dynamically fill the `[SRC]=""` tag and the text within the `<p>{{}}</p>` tags.
Good luck!

## Acceptance Criteria
- Use the correct Angular directive and place it on a `div` with id `loopContainer`.
- Use the directive to grab the element and add the element's image data property to `img src`.
- Use the directive to grab the element and add the element's title between `<p>` tags.
